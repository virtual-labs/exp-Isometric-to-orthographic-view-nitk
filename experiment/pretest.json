        "c": "The right answer is (b). If the projection lines were inclined, it would result in distortion of the objectâ€™s dimensions in the projection. This is because the angle of inclination would introduce a perspective effect, causing different parts of the object to appear larger or smaller depending on their distance from the projection plane.",
